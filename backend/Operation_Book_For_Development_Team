1. Clone the whole repo into your either Git or Github desktop ( I use desktop Github app and it looks easy after some tries)

2. Before you start making any changes or just viewing, always fetch original to get the latest updated version from the team!!!

3. Go to the cloned repo in your laptop, it should be named as Github\EatWellthy

4. use your Laptop Powershell ( for windows ), or if u are using VS Code, click Terminal on the top bar 

5. Type in this line: cd WhereYouStoreTheProject\EatWellthy       
                      e.g. cd "D:\Onedrive\Documents\GitHub\EatWellthy"
                      Copy the following code:

                      For development:
                      
                      npm install
                      npm run install-all
                      npm run dev   

7. The web app window should pop out from your default browser

8. After making changes,
   you can commit change and push to repo using github desktop app

9. Or you can delete the changes you make as long as you donot commit change, by right click the file you want to undo the changes

10. To connect your component to database, these are the files you usually need to edit:
    backend->models,routes,server.js
    clent->src->actions
    clent->src->components->reducers

11. If you need to reinstall modules, usually in client

    1. cd client
    2. For Windows: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\node_modules
       For Mac and Linux: rm -rf node_modules
    3. npm install --legacy-peer-deps 
       Next time onwards you can just use npm install, no need legacy
